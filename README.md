A demo showing you how to create interactive expand/collapse animation with UIViewPropertyAnimator

In this tutorial, I want to discuss with you another exciting way to animate your views - UIViewPropertyAnimator.  This class gives you a lot more control than its predecessor UIView.animate. With it, you can build custom timing, interactive, and interruptible animations. Furthermore, you can change the animator on the fly.
